# HR_LLM_PROJECT
 GOOGLE_GEMENI_ATS_Application


The provided Python code snippet is for a Streamlit web application that uses Google's Generative AI to analyze resumes. It imports necessary libraries, loads environment variables, and configures the Google Generative AI with an API key. The `get_gemini_response` function calls the Gemini model to generate content based on an input prompt. The `input_pdf_text` function extracts text from an uploaded PDF file. The Streamlit app has a user interface for inputting a job description and uploading a resume. When the user submits this information, the app processes the resume, generates a response using the Gemini model, and displays the results.
